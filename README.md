# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview ##

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. After showing them the results they asked if we could determine which counties voted and by what percent in the election.

  Candidate Data:
  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who received.
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

  County Data:
  1. How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
  2. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
  3. Which county had the largest number of votes?
  4. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
  5. Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

 ## Challenge Summary ##
 
 This script can be used to find other types of data useful for the election commission. You can modify the script in any number of ways to find more information on the voters as well as using it on different locations and candidates. If you have election data from different counties or with different candidates they can be easily ran through the script to find voting data.
